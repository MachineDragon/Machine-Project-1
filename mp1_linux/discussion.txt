Question 1.)

I tested my code several times using the make tutor function which displayed the errors that I needed to fix.
I found out many things trying to test out code, one of them for example is that you cannot test make tutor in another folder 
than the one already created in the cs341 folder, 
I tried to create a test folder with different code for cmds.c to run but when 
I tried running make tutor it would go back to my original cmds file from the cs341 folder. 
I also used visual studio code for error messages and fixing up my code as it is easier to edit in those programs 
rather then on Unix and transfered it over to my cs341 director. I learned a lot about using Unix and unix commands.


2.)  

If you call for a memory display of an address that does not correspond to a  memory address then you get Exception 14 at EIP=31313131: page fault. 
On UNIX I get segmentation fault The code gives different outputs on SACP and UNIX 


3.)

a.) xyz is stored in 0804a07c 

b.) pxyz is in location 0804a080 and the value is 6

c.) memory address of cmds is 0804a040, the memory address for initial is 0804830c in the usyms file and ends at 0804a088. When I use md m i get 0804896a and md for d i get 0000000d.

d.) You can't change it while it's running 



4.)

The code starts at 00100100 and ends at 001021c8 on unix.


5.) 

In Unix you get a segmentation fault, and in SACP the command line will stop working and you will get exception 14.


6.) 

The command was not found in the program


7.)

Using md to get the memory addresses of inputs and ms to change their memory addresses. 
I have had so many glitches in VM after hitting the ~d command starting over so many times until 
I figured out the exact way to make it not glitch, by opening tutor up after downloading linux, 
not having it open at the same time which was what I was doing and hitting ctr send alt delete.

8.)

I had to relearn addresses and pointers for c, as well as inputs and %values to input chars and numbers to output them, 
it took a while to setup the vm without crashing or glitching. 
The hardest part was cmds and programming it took many days, 
I had to delete the mp1_linux and start over because when I put in md I wasn't getting any output, 
this was the most time consuming part.
